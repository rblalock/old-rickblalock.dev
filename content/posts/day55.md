## Friction Log

Did a podcast episode with Cesar and Jeff Haynie on Firebase - First Time Experience.  Hopefully we’ll be releasing that early next week.

## Marketing

Today is marketing Wednesday so I spent a lot of time working on  initial experience and onboarding.  Got our welcome email with some tips for users squared away too.

## Biz.

Working lunch with Albrey
- Subscription features
- Ad and gov. sales
- New map design review
- Ad ideas for local shops
- Fish license approach(es)

## Dev.

I changed our “Regulations updating” dialog to a small dismissible overlay that comes from the top and isn’t intrusive anymore.
