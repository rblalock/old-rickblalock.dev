## Update

I’ve been silent the last week because:
- Went to TN with my dad
- In-laws were in town
- Took a trip for Mother’s Day

However, that doesn’t mean things haven’t happened!  Here’s some things:
- Artificial reefs are ready to go for the new map features
- Commercial app beta testing has been going very well
- I pitched to 10+ investors last week and having several repeat meetings with them this week

## Biz & Marketing

- Caught up with a few leads
- Took some phone calls from beta testers of the commercial app
- Worked on a strategic partnership doc
- ASO all the things

## Dev

- Small things around the rec. app to get it ready for the next big version: MAPS!
