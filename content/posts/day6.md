Reviewed an opportunity with FWC's Memorable Catch program.  Had a great meeting.  Really love how they did CAFM and I think it would improve our user's
experience as well as improve their program with our reach.  Need to work out deal specifics.

Reached out to a few possible partners like Guy Harvey's co.

Launched my personal site so I can write these notes down and publish them.

Followed up on an NGO proposal / grant.

Went over the other NFWF awards with Michael to divide and conqueror on who to target and how.

Started on the embeddable widget concept today.
