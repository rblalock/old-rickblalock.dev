## Misc.

My wife was out last week so I had the kids…while I did work and got a decent amount done, I did not journal at all…so we’re skipping to Day 112.  :-)

Who wears it better?

## Biz & Marketing

- Investor meetings.  It went well from the feedback POV.
- E-Commerce planning.
- Red Snapper Photo Competition is well under way and going well.  There’s some AMAZING shots people have submitted.
- Presentation prep for a state agency meeting for all the states in the south regions

## Dev

Mobile:

- Programmatic ads beta is available.  Now waiting on next steps.

WWDC:

A lot of today was paying attention to the new things with WWDC.    I “LOL’d” when Apple acted like they invented async / await and commented: “Async/await will allow you to have more fun writing apps”.  Pretty funny.

Other than that, the updates were typically incremental but they are good incremental improvements.
