## Business

Today was “sales Monday”…on Wednesday. :-). Michael is in town so I moved the theme’d days around.  We planned out several things today:
- Government campaigns
- NGO campaigns
- The photo competition when we launch the new app

I had a call with one of our API customers on how to use the regulation API in their app.  Should be fun!

I had a call with NOAA on making it easy to manage certain commercial regulations inside of fish.management.

Booked a couple meetings for next week with potential new customers.

## Dev

Minor bug fixes across the web and the commercial app is all for today.
