[Checkout this crazy fishing stat from NOAA][1]

## Biz

I received some excellent feedback from ONESIXONE on my pitch deck.  I was showing them the deck I emailed out and they pointed out that is fundamentally different than the one you use for presentations, so we went through it and made it a lot simpler.  They also passed [AirBNBâ€™s deck][2] from a while ago.  I love the simplicity.

Met with a potential industry partner today, focused on commercial fishing.

## Dev

The new fish management app is almost there but frustratingly not there. ðŸ˜¡

BigQuery for days.
