I ran in to a “Top thing that is annoying with SaaS companies” when I tried to get beta access to Algolia’s [recommendation engine][1] feature: They booked a meeting with a sales guy, on the call pointed out we have to be an Algolia customer to get access to it, stated I don’t have a need for it…”Ok give us a call when you do”.  I…don’t…want…to…talk to anyone…just give me access when I can.

Other things for today:

- Worked on some new map integrations with NOAA
- Researched a TON of MRIP data and approaches, electronic logging programs, etc.
- Researched state license programs and read up on some contracts.
