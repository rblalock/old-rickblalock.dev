Apparently [bagpipe rave music][1] is a thing.

Today was mostly a technical day.

Worked on animating the contour SVGâ€™s.  [Turned out nice][2].

Started on the regulation list / location bar area of v6.  Spent a TON of time trying to decide how to do the sticky header layout.  Finally ended with something nice.

Had a meeting for 2hr+ with Daniel on revamping Fish Management for commercial plus groundwork for the future.

Had a brief meeting with Michael to catch up on some biz dev outreaches.
