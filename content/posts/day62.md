[On long-term thinking][1]. “Don’t be the best, be the only” 💪

## Biz.

I’ve neglected some emails yesterday due to focused-work, so the morning was eaten up with follow up.  All good though!  Good conversations going with government agencies, NGO’s, a few fish rules users, etc. I have several meetings for next week scheduled with potential new customers now.

Almost ready for our photo competition.  Hopefully if the details are ironed out I can whip up a marketing page on it tomorrow and we can announce it on Thursday.

## Dev

Updated our CitSci verbiage based on feedback from one of our partners.

Still waiting for the Fish management rev. to get done so we can wrap up the commercial app.  😭
