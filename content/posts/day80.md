Watch of the day: [“Generate Leads”][1]

## Biz & Marketing

Generated the TOS and privacy policy for the new commercial app.  If you haven’t tried this site, it’s a huge time saver: [Iubenda][2].

Signed up for that super annoying LinkedIN Sales tool that lets you spam people about connecting so I can sell them things…and then hit up 100 or so people in Mass. that are related to bait and tackle stores, charter boat, and marinas. 🤷‍♂️

## Dev

Sent out invites to the commercial beta.  Also added the following to the commercial app:
- Report violation
- Fix measurement tile
- Explainer for quota measurement
- Tweak fuzzy search for species
