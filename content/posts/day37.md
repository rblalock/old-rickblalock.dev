Good read of the day: [“The Case for Solving Core Problems”][1] 

## Business

Had a great call with NOAA going over the commercial app beta feedback.  It’s nice we’re at the part where I can fix or change feedback in this app during the call.

A Government IT department is being difficult with “security” reasons they don’t want to allow integration.  As someone who’s worked on countless similar “integrations” … it’s 99.9% of the time an excuse.  Especially for what we’re talking about doing.  Very frustrating.  This is why I don’t like it when people say, “Oh, you’re in IT?”.  No, please don’t associate me with IT.  :-)

Today was “strategy Friday’s” but didn’t get to any of it because of the mad rush to get v6 out.  I pushed it some to the next strategy Friday and some to Monday.

My ponder of the day:

## Dev

I fixed several issues of the commercial app while on the call this morning.  I’ll fix the rest on Tuesday during “mobile Tuesdays”.

I met with Albrey over lunch and we hammered on v6 and came up with a decent size list of things to knock out.  Got all of them done and sent a new build out to beta testers (we’re at almost 100 beta testers now).
