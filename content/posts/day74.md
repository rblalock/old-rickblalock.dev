I know it‚Äôs fundamental, but this was helpful today: [common valuation methods][1].

## Misc.

The biggest problem with having to access to analytics at a moment‚Äôs notice?  I‚Äôm constantly checking them.  All.  The.  Time.

Joined a pitch night with ONESIXONE.  First time using this new deck so it was rough but I‚Äôm grateful for the practice.  Got some super valuable feedback from it too.  Not surprisingly, ‚ÄúBe more concise‚Äù was one of the notes.  üòÜ

## Marketing

We launched our first [photo competition][2] today.  It runs the whole month of April.  Within the first few hours we‚Äôve got some great submissions.  This will be fun to watch.  Sent a bunch of messaging on a few different channels around this today.

## Dev

#### Rec. App:
- Better information for users in locations that Fish Rules does not support
- Bug fixes & small UI tweaks
- Test on android
- Submit to app stores for testing

#### Commercial App:
The nice thing about having similar apps is we can use similar conventions and code.  Makes things go faster.
- Added notification that regs are downloading, like the rec. app
- Test on Android
