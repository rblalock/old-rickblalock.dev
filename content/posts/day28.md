What a great thread for ideas.  Seeing what others work on, in such a succinct way, it’s much more interesting than a pitch deck.

## Business

Not much for today on the business front:
- Had a call with a potential industry partner.  Not much to come out of it yet but when we do our PRO subscription, there could be a really good opportunity.
- Tweaked the investor deck based on a bunch of feedback I’ve been getting the last few days.  Biggest gaps: Competition information, and projections.
- Followed up on 3 leads that I’ve spoken with in the past 2 weeks.

## Dev

[This guy][1] has some great libraries for React Native.

I spent almost the entire time today working on the mobile app with an emphasis on getting the fish logging capabilities ready to go.  Here’s a list:
- Trip list screen wired up
- Trip detail screen wired up
- Create / Delete Trip handling wired up
- Fish Log screens wired up
- “Trip Basket” concepts implemented
- Fix misc. bugs that have popped up in the last week

I spent exactly 1hr trying to get Android to build a release version of the app.  So frustrating.  Turns out it was the Android Studio memory heap just filling up.  It needs 4gb!?  I had to update Android Studio too.
