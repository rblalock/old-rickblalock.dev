Funny.  Matt and I were just talking about how communication is hard and very few people are good at it.  And I saw this tweet:

## Misc.

When I hydroplaned and wrecked my car a few weeks ago, the trooper gave me a citation for crashing, “Because there were no eye witnesses”.  He said if I took it to court I would win but that’s a pain and more money than just paying the citation.  However if I pay the citation I “admit fault” and points go on my license. However however, if I pay and take a state approved driver’s ed. class, the points go away.  Funny how money makes problems go away isn’t it?  So I sat through some of the course this morning.  Bleh.

## Biz.

Few meetings for possible NGO leads.  There’s some synergy there but probably only for grant type work.

## Dev.

Commercial work for dayzzzzzz.
