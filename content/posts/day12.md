It’s interesting trying to get in to a groove in this bootstrapped scenario.  No habits formed yet but everything I’m doing is habit forming.  Gotta be mindful of that.  Also, determining what must be done now vs. later is so important … it’s constantly on the top of my mind.

_How the day went:_

Marketing and PR time:
- Researched something that will help us email all our users that have created a Fish Rules account from a while ago.
- We have a TON of emails to port over and things get pricey.  Settled on Mailjet / Mailgun for transactional email for now but need users to “opt-in” to our new newsletter, so I have that separated out using Mailchimp.
- Preview [here][2]
- I want to send this off tomorrow.

Planning out our government outreach for first of the year has been fun.  Most of the work today was on the sales deck and package that we’ll be sending out.  We haven’t started on the collation of contacts and such we need for the campaign but need to.

Speaking of, the [deck template][3] Andrew designed for us is looking nice.

Apart from the government outreach plans, Michael and I also met about the new advertisers that want to onboard with us in January, which is exciting.  I’m stoked about the fish mount possibilities too.

Sent out our first API pricing sheet to two customers…”Do something, even if it’s wrong” is strong in this case. :-D

Good working lunch with Albrey to talk through misc. work items
- Fish log improvements
- Photo competitions
- Government outreach
- Advertisement progress updates

Fixed weird bugs with image resizing on the trip log on the web app.  Switched to use NextJS’s Image component now, which works great for those screens.

Approved the proposal for the commercial regulation updates for Fish Management.  Hopefully we get that done by end of Jan. :-)

I needed to get to some of the commercial app features but didn’t even get to do that.  Maybe tonight…
