## Misc.

A new Friction Log podcast episode is available today.  This time it’s around a [first-time experience aound Rockset][1].

## Marketing & Biz

Answered some questions for a reporter writing a story about Fish Rules.

Followed up with a customer and several potential ones.

WE WERE ACCEPTED IN TO THE GOOGLE CLOUD STARTUP PROGRAM.  Hurray!  That’ll help with our bootstrap budget some.  :-)

## Dev

I’ve just discovered [stitchdata.com][2] and tried it by moving data from my analytics db to BigQuery.  Worked like a charm.  I might be able to use this instead…prototype underway.

More commercial app work.
