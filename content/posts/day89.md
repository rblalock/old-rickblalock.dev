## Biz & Marketing

- Got on the phone with some partners for planning
- Scheduled some new state meetings
- Met with an App Store marketer to help with some Fish Rules marketing plans this coming month.

## Dev

Recreational app:

Waypoints!  Add this feature to the new map area.  Only thing left is to allow users to select an icon for a waypoint.

Commercial app:

Met with our agency partners to go over beta feedback. Addressed  numerous things:

- Moved the “zone” around to the top
- Map agencies to spelled out names
- CitSci info
- Localize numbers (commas and such)
- Fix alignment issues during onboarding, for Android
- Try out some “Progressive Reduction” design techniques to help anglers better understand certain parts of the app.
