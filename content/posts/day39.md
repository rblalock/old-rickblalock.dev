## Dev

I decided to prototype the in-app subscription things we’ve been talking about.  It’s a lot more headache than I realized.  Services like RevenueCat make it less painful but my goodness Apple makes things very complicated and convoluted.  I don’t mind the 15-30% rev. share but it’d be nice if they used some of those funds to focus on the developer and back-office subscription management things.

It took me all day, but I got it in: Pro subscription that removes ads, you can ask for a human (expert) to ID a fish, and support sustainable fisheries.  Woot.

I [found this helpful][1] for running React native on device, in debug.
