[The Rise of “Reality Entrepreneurs”][1] is a good read/listen.

## Biz & Marketing

- Email newsletter announcement for maps and reefs
- All things for the commercial launch next week are ready, just waiting to push the button now. (They’re actually live in the App Stores right now btw)
- Followed up on a few partnership opportunities
- Worked on financial projections (my least favorite thing in the world)
- [Fishing license survey][2] is live.

## Dev

- Marketing website prep for commercial announcement next week
- Mobile: make filters more obvious what is set
- Mobile: Tell android users to open the chrome browser when logging in via email link login
- Mobile: Local listings on map
