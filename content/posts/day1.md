Health insurance health insurance health insurance!  Drinking from the firehose of health insurance.

Gusto is pretty nice.  Has a nice setup, can get most everything up and running in less than a day (of course health insurance keeps it from being instant...but they do a good job of walking through the issues).  It's also REALLY expensive outside of Cali it seems?

Tried to sign up for [https://sanabenefits.com/](https://sanabenefits.com/) but never got an activation link

[https://sidecarhealthinsurance.com/](https://sidecarhealthinsurance.com/) Is an interesting alternative too, and I was able to get a quote in about 30 min.

[HealthCare.gov](http://healthcare.gov) was a bazillion $ and took an hour or so to get setup.

I also met with our designer, Andrew, about pitch deck design, embeddable widgets, and some sales collateral.

I have a long list of "todo's" for actual business / marketing / development...that I didn't get done today...because of HEALTH INSURANCE.  Some things I did get to focus on:

- Embeddable widget follow up
- New fish log addition follow up

So...basically follow-ups...meh.
