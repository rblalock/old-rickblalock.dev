## Misc.

Waking up early is so useful.  I looked at the clock, it was 7:30AM and thought “WOW! I’ve gotten so much done and the day hasn’t started yet”.

## Biz.

Worked on next part of our subscription biz.  Had a great call with a potential partner where we could sell their awesome product in the app.

## Dev

In-app messages now target user’s locations (or regulation boundaries of the location).  Added in-app message management to  our admin area.
