## Biz.

Payroll day.  It’s always funny running payroll in Gusto for just one employee (me!).  I like doing it in Gusto though and it’s good for muscle memory so things are smooth when we add more employees.

Added a few new programs to our citizen science page.  One of the ones requested to be listed, I don’t think we’re going to list until they become partners and they run the program through Fish Rules.  It’s in direct conflict with what we’re trying to accomplish with Fish Rules.  I don’t know why we would encourage something that is is propagating a UX problem and friction in the industry, especially since we’re actively trying to fix the problem and friction.

## Dev

Built out a draft for our photo competition marketing page.  Check it out [here][1].  Still working out some details.  We’re launching this April 1st.

Deployed a prototype of our internal analytics (ads, usage, reg views, logging, etc.) to our internal app.  It works great…but once deployed I realized Vercel’s server less functions have a 5mb response body limit.  So I’m going to have to lift some of this to another spot.  :-/
