Whew.  Rough night last night.  Couldnâ€™t sleep at all.  The morning bike ride helped wake me up though.

I wanted to work on outreach this morning but decided to try to get the mobile app a little further down the road.

Man the sticky header + all the extra elements that should come in depending on the state of the scroll view can be really frustrating to deal with initially.  Spent all morning working on it.  Afternoon and evening did some work on the drawer and location modal.

Did some light follow up on some of our partnership leads, confirmed direction for additions to Fish Management + Commercial.
