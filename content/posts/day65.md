## Biz.

Met with the commercial app partners to shore up the launch plan.

Met with a Rockset sales person to talk through using it for our  reporting.  It’s really good and solid and what I’d want to use.  But it’s also going to cost us $14k / year.  :-/ .  Big picture, that’s really not that much money considering what it would cost to build a data / analytics pipeline (resource and money wise).

Photo competition is just about ready to launch.

Got to contact the winners of the local business nominations.

## Dev

Fixed various things.  Nothing special today.  Although..I did have a mild panic attack thinking some of our analytics was mis-configured…but it wasn’t.  Whew.
