## Biz and Marketing

We launched our [April photo competition][1] marketing page today.  In less than an hour we had 200 registrants…it’ll be fun to see how many register by/or-in April for the competition.  Some links for this:
- [Website][2]
- [Rules][3]
- [Registration form][4]

Also, over the weekend we awarded our nominations for the [local business listings][5].  The winners are now in the app, in their respective areas.

Since today is “Sales Mondays”, almost the entire day was spent following up with leads, talking to customers, and meeting with some possible customers.  Some great convos! One of them I REAAALLLY want to do something with.

## Dev

The commercial app (specifically Fish Management’s commercial support) is still not ready.  Super frustrating on this front.
