## Friction Log

Cesar and I took Github Copilot for a first-time experience spin.  The results were fantastic!  Really fun to watch some of this ML stuff practically play out for a developer.  I was particular struck by how well it did with _“Remove cars from the array that start with ‘F’”_.  **Lots of potential!**

[Check out the video.][1]

I’m semi-considering a mini-series where I use Copilot to learn a new language, to see how fast and helpful it can be for that sort of thing.

## Biz

Worked on some e-commerce package ideas, researched out how we’ll manage the store, etc.

Board meeting decks…
