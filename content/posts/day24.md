## Business

Today was “mobile Tuesday” and it comprised entirely of the Commercial app and tweaking things to get it ready for beta testers.  There’s a lot of content tweaks that have to happen separately.  There’s some beta testers we can onboard now that are high-level testers that won’t focus on the content; we’ll probably add them later this week.

2 potential customers reached out today.  All from the calls and effort that was put in last week.

## Dev

As mentioned earlier, mainly Commercial app tweaks.  Really not a lot of things but enough to fill half of the day.

I also started to add the API key provisioning functionality to our admin area of Fish Rules, so we can manage the keys, and check on our customers’ API requests in a given month, etc.  Still have several things to do but the CRUD part of the work is done.
