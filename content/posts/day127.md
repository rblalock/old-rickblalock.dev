[Uhhh. Wow Github!][1].  I got the beta invite too.  It’s amazing!  Truly one of the most powerful things in dev tools I’ve seen in a long long time.

## Biz / Sales / Marketing

[Some folks in NC helping spread the Fish Rules word][2].  Nice!

Worked on several decks (Marketing Wednesday of course!)

## Dev

- Last min bugs and tweaks and then submitted updates to Play / App Store.  Of course the programmatic ads didn’t load on Android.  🙄 .  Did some troubleshooting and reading the inter-webs about it. 🤷‍♂️
- Updated Mailchimp sign-up flow(s)
