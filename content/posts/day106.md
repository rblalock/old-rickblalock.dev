## Misc.

I’ve been pretty under the weather yesterday and again today.  Definitely affecting my productivity.

Another thing I’ve noticed that affects productivity: Waiting for a meeting.  Even if it’s “in 30 min”, the mental distraction of knowing it’s coming up can be inhibiting.

## Biz & Marketing

Spun up a [landing page][1] for the new maps and reefs for the sole purpose of having a ProductHunt announcement for tomorrow that some folks are helping hunt.

Fleshed out some more of our 3 year plan.

## Dev

Worked on some architectural drawings for what fishing licenses would be like with a potential partner.
