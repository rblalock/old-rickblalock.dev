Commercial fishing is dangerous!

_“Commercial fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations in the United States. During 2000–2017, commercial fishermen experienced a fatality rate of 114 deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers, compared with an average of 4 deaths per 100,000 FTE workers among all U.S. workers.”_

## Biz

Wrapped up all the feedback for our pitch deck.  It’s now:

- Way more concise
- Better focus on TAM/SAM/SOM
- Timeline / Roadmap plan

We had a great shout out from a big YouTube influencer over the weekend.  It’s generated a lot of traffic which is great.  The downside is a LOT of inland-states anglers are writing in asking why we don’t support their state yet.  The upside to that: I can link them to their local wildlife management agency and ask them to contact them to support Fish Rules.

## Dev

Some of the commercial database structure changed so quickly pushed out a fix for that so Albrey could test while building out the regs.

Fixed a few mobile app bugs that have been nagging.  `filter` vs. `find` has a very important nuanced difference when returning from it, in JavaScript!

Got some sweet data exports from BigQuery, for a study in New England.  The Stitch -\> BQ pipeline works well!
