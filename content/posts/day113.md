## Biz & Marketing

Interview on Miami Community News [is live][1].

Recorded and pushed out some “how to” videos: [Setting Manual Location][2] & [Logging Fish][3].

## Dev

Another app I manage (has nothing to do with Fish Rules) was rejected by the Play Store for using “Background Location Services”.  The problem was, it wasn’t! I inspected the bundle and it’s not even declared nor the API’s inside.  ugh.  Turns out, Google was looking at a bundle that was irrelevant.  I guess that’s the problem with the “track” approach in the Play console.

- Added a [link][4] to our fish mounting form, on our competition page. Mike brought it up and might as well put it there. 🤷‍♂️
