## Marketing

Well I’m behind the 8-ball on marketing version 6.  Between talking to Matt for ideas, reading articles [like this one][1] on HubSpot, and debating hiring someone on Fiverr to write a press release, today has me scrambling to get this done.  This morning I started a [Press/Media kit][2] in Notion; it’s not much but at least it’s a place to throw things on when needed.  Spun up a [ProductHunt page][3] too, though it doesn’t feel like the right user base (especially judging from the limited topics they let you pick from)…but hey why not?

## Misc.

Had an interesting call with a Firebase (Google) employee.  It was a user-research / sentiment call but it was fun.

## Dev

Mostly it was fixing bugs with the new release and trying to get to the commercial app.
