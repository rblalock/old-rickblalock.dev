## Misc.

This [flat data][1] stuff from GitHub is mind blowing.

## Biz

Spent most of the day following up with customers, users, investor relations, etc.

Finished all the initial content and media collateral for the commercial app.  It’s submitted to the app stores too!

## Dev

Sent out a “final” build for the commercial app, now pointed to production.

Wrapped up some marketing stuff for commercial, on the main site.

For the rec. app, we did some ASO so I needed to push a new build…so I quickly added the “Set location here” to the reefs so users can check the regs for that location.  Also tried out some better clustering of the map shapes to see if it loads faster for the NC reefs.
