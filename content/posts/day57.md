I’ve been a little quiet.  Had a pretty bad wreck over the weekend.

Apart from that, some work and news has happened this week:

- Ready to launch our local listing subscription for local businesses.  [Check it out here][1]
- Ready to launch our “Nominate your local bait and tackle” campaign.  [Here’s the form][2].
- Launched new In-App messaging features
- Got some great referrals to government agencies and rewarded the folks with ProStaff subscriptions
- A new government partner reached out about selling fishing licenses for them
