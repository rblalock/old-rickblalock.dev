“Don’t Become What You’re Trying to Disrupt…Startups can’t afford this. You have to think like a contrarian. You have to resist the temptation to follow the tried and tested. Startup innovation is all about venturing into the unknown and blazing your own trail.”, 🔥 🔥 🔥 Good read on new market creation from [NFX][1].

## Misc.

Recorded a podcast with Cesar, for Friction Log.  This one was around [Rockset][2].

## Marketing and Biz

By the numbers:
- Prep for photo competition
- Talk to a few potential customers and partners
- Got a run down on fish management’s commercial features (hopefully done tomorrow!)

## Dev

Met with [Rockset][3] SA around our use case.  Interesting product.

Today was a lot of prototyping for new analytics features we’ll eventually put in our Fish Management product.  Check out a screenshot here:
