## Marketing

Today is ‚ÄúMarketing Wednesday‚Äù so I focused some time on marketing related work:

[Submitted][1] information for Fish Rules to be featured on the App Store.

I hadn‚Äôt set up the Safari meta tag that takes users to the App Store.  It was so easy, can‚Äôt believe I hadn‚Äôt done this yet:

```ts
<meta name="apple-itunes-app" content="app id=597875361" />
```

I decided to delay the press release until we launch this next version (probably over the weekend), which has a citizen science opt-in with links to participating programs (It‚Äôll look better on the press release).

## Biz.

Some really progress and news on the ad side, government side, and NGO side.  Not going to take the time and type it up tonight though.  Sorry :-)

## Dev

Fixed some very minor issues that have popped up, across all our digital properties (i.e. It‚Äôs ‚ÄúSaltwater‚Äù not ‚ÄúSalt Water‚Äù ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

Introduced some new features and wrapped up new features I started on Monday:

- You can now opt-in to citizen science programs from the account page
- Set your home dock on the account page
- New "Notification Manager" screen where you can opt-in to important notices, announcements, and offers
- Favorites now will save to your Fish Rules account.  That way you can take your favorites with you across devices or if you re-install the app.
- The location page now will let you open a full-screen map for selecting a manual location
- Selecting the "List" or "Image" view filter will save that setting across uses
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes
