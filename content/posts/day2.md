Co-founder coffee meeting to go over all the decisions we have to make:

- What's priority
- Go over existing deals or potential deals
- Agree on salary, health insurance, plans, etc.
- Investment strategy

Also, did a ton of email follow-up of inflight leads and deals (almost entirely government based emails).

We have a hubspot account setup for managing AD deals, so I started loading in all our other business accounts that equate to revenue, in to hubspot too.  It's pretty nice, though all the extra clicking around gets tiresome.

Had a nice intro call with potential investors today as well.
