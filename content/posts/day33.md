## Misc.

Cesar got a [new Friction Log][2] up today.  I also published [some smaller friction logs][3] across a few things I’ve been using  Can’t wait to do the podcasts!

## Business

Only a little today as the v6 mobile blitz continues.  
- A few calls were scheduled for ads, commercial app, etc.
- Got investor info and video uploaded
- Reviewed more beta feedback for the commercial app

## Dev

All mobile v6 stuff.  Here were the internal Test Flight notes:

- Setting a location via map or lat/lon persists until you change it, across app sessions.
- Loader enhancements
- Reg list enhancements
- Local/Federal toggle fixed
- Ads do a slow fade now so not as jarring
- Ads now can be placed inside the fish log (by species and location)
- TL/FL measurement images
- Push notifications
- In app messaging
