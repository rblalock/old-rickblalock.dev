## Misc.

[“How to Pitch Your Startup”][1] was a good listen this morning.

## Biz

Had a really interesting call with a non-profit doing fish image labelling. [https://www.fishial.ai/][2] .  I really like what they’re doing and they’re the first group in this industry I feel has a decent handle of the problem at hand.  It’d be interesting to see how many citizen-science minded Fish Rules users would be interested in helping with this effort.

I sent emails and pitch decks and videos to 25+ angel/VC firms today.  I gotta say, YCom’s questions are great.  It made me realize I need to adjust some things to touch on those points.  They ask probably the most interesting questions.  Much better than the standard 3-form field contact forms, lol.

## Dev / Design

In prep. for the big fishing expo in the summer, I went ahead and ordered a bunch of generic cards.  Bleh.  Haven’t used print stuff in a long time.

Also met with Andrew on doing some concepts for a new mapping feature we want to push out.  More on that in the future.

Mobile work today was around the recreational app:
- Added a citizen science opt-in field
- Added a “home port” option so we can default to a certain area automatically
- Fixed some bugs around the subscription page
- Fixed a few minor android crashes
- Tweaked the FlatList to be more performant.  When toggling view types, the scroll view goes to the top now, since it doesn’t make sense to maintain position
- Fixed a few minor things not worth mentioning
