On feedback, Jason gets the quote of the day.  The ending of this quote especially struck me:

## Misc.

Continuing the YCOM / Stanford series, listened to Peter Thiel’s [“Competition is for losers”][1].  The “lies people tell” was good.

I didn’t get a lot done today (at least it felt like it…I still knocked off most of the things on my list).  Maybe it’s because it felt like half the day I was doom scrolling the “revolution” on Twitter.

## Business

A state agency reached out to become a partner!  Stoked.  It’s the salt water side of the agency, still gotta get the fresh water side on board too (although technically they’re 2 different customers).

I worked on the investment deck, it’s about 90% done.  Hopefully I never have to use it :-D.

Since today is “Marketing Wednesday” I spent almost all my time on marketing related plans we’re going to do: Government agency outreach, follow up on top-of-funnel leads, and reach out to a bunch of customers on “what’s coming” at the end of the month.

## Dev.

Nothing.  Literally.  I didn’t touch a code editor once.  Crazy.     That hasn’t happened in a long time.
