## Misc.

Recorded a podcast with an old friend of mine, Ryan.  Fun times.

Apple’s conference:  Meh.  I was hoping for a reason to buy a new iPad but didn’t get a reason.

## Biz.

Practice pitch night with a bunch of folks, in prep. for the pitch night on Thursday.

## Dev

Literally worked all day on trying to make this stupid custom tab bar WORK.  WHY is this always the most frustrating part with mobile……GRRRR.

Of course, I stepped away for a few, cleared my head and immediately came up with a better solution and implemented it in  less than an hour.
