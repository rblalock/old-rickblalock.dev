## Biz & Marketing

Caught up with Michael on ad and local biz listing plans and progress.  We’ve had some signups this week!  Stoked this is starting to get some traction.

I got some inbound interest from an outdoor company that would be a really good partnership.  Can’t wait to talk to them.

Talked with some folks over at the Georgia DNR.  Would love to get them as a customer soon.

## Dev

Caught up with Daniel on changes near and far term, around Fish Management.

Fixed some Commercial app bugs, implemented feedback, sent out a new build.

Struggled through yet another sqlite DB update bug.  Turns out on Android you have to do a lot more hand holding when switching over to a new file.

Mobile: Added some more waypoint functionality, fixed a few bugs, adjusted a few things based on feedback from yesterday.
