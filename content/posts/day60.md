## Misc.

Did a fun interview with Jeff Haynie on startup life.  Check it out [here][1].

## Business

Getting the local listing stuff ready to launch.  Zapier is so helpful! I needed an easy way to keep track of which listings aren’t live … hook up Chargebee to Zapier to Google Sheets … DONE.

Had a great, fun call with a potential strategic partner.  Excited about the future.

## Dev.

Started playing around with some more powerful analytics tools that will help our customers in the future.  Rockset is pretty sweet!
