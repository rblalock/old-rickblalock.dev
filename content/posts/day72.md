Stumbled upon this article after all this big data stuff, BigQuery, Rockset, etc. work.  [“Space-time tradeoff”][1]

## Misc.

Spent a few hours and picked up a new car to replace the one we wrecked.  The Model Y is a lot roomier than the 3.  Not as sporty though.

## Biz

Lots of meetings today with: Industry leader, NGO in Alabama, angel investor, Albrey.

It’s always fun to meet with NGO’s that immediately get our value-add and rave about it.  :-)

Had a fun strategic meeting with a company today.

## Dev

Commercial app:
- Fix misc. visual bugs
- Wire up local / remote images
- Quota handling changes
- Deploy latest for testing

Recreational app:
- Show more user-friendly error message on reg. download error
- Improve “report” species verbiage for protected animals such as right whales
- Location specific regulations get their own pill box
