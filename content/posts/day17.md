## Misc.

[Gusto’s][2] healthcare and payroll stuff is kicking off now that it is the end of the month.  Seems like it’s going quite smoothly.  I’d highly recommend [checking them out][3].

I have a cold and it’s wearing on me today.  Today is the first day in the last 17 days where I felt like I didn’t get near as many things done as I could’ve, and I think it’s because of this cold.

## Business

Today is “Marketing Wednesday”…

I tried to sign-up for as many state fisheries newsletters as possible today.  Ooof, not a fun experience.

One of the things we’ve needed for a long time is ASO (App store optimization) work and simple marketing too, just in general.  I created a checklist of things I need to work on and do every week (with the emphasis on Wednesdays).  Here’s some of it:
- ProductHunt work (posting it, generating hype, new features, etc.)
- Find roundup lists for fishing and get on them (hit up writers that could generate then, etc.)
- Work on App Store Optimizations: Better screenshots (experiment with different ones), better descriptions, optimize keywords, reach out to reviewers (work on getting better reviews or improving existing ones)
- Submit app to a few of the award ceremonies (both app awards but also industry ones)
- Start work on getting app featured by Google/Apple (yes there’s actually work that has to be done for this to happen…)
- Hit up news agencies on new features, plans, etc. and get in a habit of doing it
- Advertising landing pages

A state reached out about partnering with Fish Rules today! 💪

ASA personas are gold: [https://asafishing.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ASA\_Visual\_Report\_Digital.pdf][4].  I’ll be processing a lot of this on Friday.

## Dev.
Mobile progress today included lots of work around the fish logging flow(s).  [Here’s a video][5] of the progress.
