Day was a short day because my wife and I went out on a date. :-)

Ran first payroll from Gusto to get the payroll time in so healthcare can start on Jan. 1st.  Interesting that they need at least 2 weeks of payroll data but don’t explain why…

Made some [good progress][1] on the mobile app.

At the beginning of the month I sent out a push notification that we launched trip log functionality.  It’s interesting the residual effects a mass push notification has to the traffic of the app - [Check out the graph][2].

### Second Week Summary:
- On par for the same amount of emails and outreach that went on for AD’s.  Got a few companies committed as well.
- Started on v6 of the mobile app, laid some basic foundations, and got UI for a few of the screens done.
- Ready to go on adding the commercial regulation support in to Fish Management.  We’re going to green-field it and move over recreational afterward.
- Good first-time calls with potential government customers
