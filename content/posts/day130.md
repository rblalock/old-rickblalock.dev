I started an experiment with the hypothesis: “I can learn Python with just Github Copilot”.

It was a pretty fun experiment, although I probably should’ve had more criteria and structure set up ahead of time.  However, I did approach this with the way I learn things fast.

Overall I think I was able to infer a lot of the basic and primitive things of Python.  I certainly got stuck on a few things in that last video and felt like being able to look things up would be a faster learning experience.

Here’s a link to the [playlist][1].
