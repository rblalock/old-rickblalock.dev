## Biz & Marketing

[Check out][1] Kevin’s epic tuna he submitted for the photo competition.

Met with a super cool NGO, one of my favorites.  It was a solid 1hr meeting on how we can work together.  Follow up on next steps in a week.

We got our first annual subscription to the [local listing][2] product.  HURRAY!  

## Dev

Here’s the list for today:
- Added performance management in the recreational app.
- Added app version to sidebar of rec app
- Commercial app got some bug fixes
- In the commercial app, found a bad crash that happens on some Android devices running certain versions.  Only happens on device so it makes it tricky to troubleshoot.  Took way too much time to figure this one out.
